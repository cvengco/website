<p>I am on a journey in this labyrinth of life to become the best human that I can be!</p>

<p>What keeps me moving along this journey and opening up new roads on my path is continual self-learning and self-improvement.</p>

<p class="mb-5">One of the paths that I am discovering and exploring is the pursuit of knowledge in programming and technology.  
  This blog is a place where I can document and journal my findings and discoveries along the way.</p>
