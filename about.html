<p>I am on a journey in this labyrinth to become the best human that I can be!</p>

<p>What keeps me moving along this journey and opens up new paths is continual self-learning and self-improvement.</p>

<p class="mb-5">One of the areas that I am exploring and diving deeply into is expanding my knowledge of programming and technology.  This blog is a place where I can document and journal about my findings along the way.</p>
